## Resource List

**Construction Materials**: It can be used for construction and upgrading buildings.

**Steel:** Steel can be a fundamental resource for producing military units, buildings, and infrastructure. It's a vital component for modern weapons and machinery.

**Fuel:** Fuel is necessary for powering military vehicles and aircraft. It can also be used for base expansion and resource transportation.

**Electronics:** Electronics are essential for advanced technologies and research. They can improve unit performance and unlock advanced units and structures.

**Ammunition:** Ammunition is crucial for military units. Players can produce different types of ammunition for various unit types, such as bullets, missiles, or shells.

## Resources Growth Formula

$k \times 30 \times 1.1659144^{x}$

Where $x$ corresponds to the building level and $k$ corresponds to the server growing factor (default is 1).

So in a server with growing factor 1, a level 10 building will produce $1 \times 30 \times 1.1659144^{10} = 139.25$ resources per hour.

## Warehouse's capacity

$k \times 1000 \times 1.230171515^{x}$

Where $k$ is the server growing factor and $x$ is the warehouse's level.

So in a server with growing factor 1, a level 10 warehouse will be able to store $1 \times 1000 \times 1.230171515^{10} = 7937$ of each resource.
